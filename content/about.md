# Linux, CTFs and privacy paranoia

Are some thing my friends could tease me about (especially the last one, I will probably write a post about it), no I don't consider myself a "special snowflake" just because I use linux and vim but rather want to encourage people to start using simpler open source software that do one thing but do it well, away from huge corporations that profit on the mass data farming of its users.

 - I love linux, started as a way to force my self to learn but I ended up enjoying the simplicity, modularity and freedom that linux offers.
 - I am a privacy advocate and consider technological privacy a fundamental right in todays world.
 - C is my favourite programming language due to the power it gives to the programmer to manipulate memory.
