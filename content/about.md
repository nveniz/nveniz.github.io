Hello and welcome to my small space in the word wide web,

I'm a Computer Science that likes to learn/mess around with different technologies in order to achieve technological idependency, I am interested in Systems programming, Networks, Binary exploitation and Penetration testing (since it combines all of them).

I get really excited about learning how software we take for granded works, and personally enjoy minimalistic open source software and tools that are well written and avoid unessesary complexity.

Some more things about me:
 - I use Linux exclusively, started as a way to force my self to learn linux but I ended up enjoying the simplicity, modularity and freedom tha linux offers.
 - I am a privacy advocate and consider technological privacy a fundemental right in todays world.
 - C is my favourite programming language due to the power it gives to the programmer to manipulate memory, as I find it easier to understand that languages closer to human language (like Python)
 - I like writting small bash programs to automate daily tasks
 - On my free time I enjoy playing CTFs, HTB and other computer related puzzle games.


Tech skills that I am confident at:
 - C programming
 - Automization (bash scripting, ansible)
 - Virtualization (KVM, docker etc.)
 - Systems/Socket programming (in C Linux)
 - System administration/Server deployment
