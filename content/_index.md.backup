#### Hello and welcome to my small internet space
This is a presonal blog site that I plan on using to write about things that I find interesting as well as showcase some of my projects that I find cool.

In addition to the menu you can also navigate using:
- [Tags in use](/tags)
- [Posts archive](/archive)


You can request my CV using on of the listed communication methods above and you can also read the [about page](/about) to learn more about me.

**Not much to see except the about page. More coming soon! (busy **
