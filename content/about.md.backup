## Linux, CTFs and privacy paranoia

Are some thing my friends could tease me about (especially the last one, more about it [here](/posts/thoughts-on-privacy)), if I had to describe myself with one word that would be curious since I'm alway trying to understand the how world around us works. I enjoy talking with people and I am constantly reminded that each one of us has a different perspective and ideology in life. 

Below are some of the more "technical" things, if you want to have a talk you can find me on the socials I have listed on the home page, thanks for reading!

 - Computer science student, interested in systems programming, networking, binary analysis / exploitation and pen testing
 - I love linux, started as a way to force my self to learn but I ended up enjoying the simplicity, modularity and freedom that linux offers.
 - I am a privacy advocate and consider technological privacy a fundamental right in todays world.
 - C is my favourite programming language due to the power it gives to the programmer to manipulate memory.
 - I like writting small bash programs to automate daily tasks
 - On my free time I enjoy playing CTFs, HTB and other computer related puzzle games.
